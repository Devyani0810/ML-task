# ML-task
# Task 1: CampusPulse
1)Objective: Review anonymized student survey data to develop new insights and predictive models.
2)Completed Levels
3)Variable Identification Regimen: Used exploratory data analysis (EDA) to determine the anonymized variables.
4)Data Quality Assessment: Removed null data and other unusable data and made data ‘good’ through statistical imputations.
5)Exploratory Insight Report: Made more than 5 insights and visualizations.
6)Relationship Prediction Model: Developed classifiers (e.g. Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost).
7)Model Explanation with SHAP: Used SHAP to explain our predictions.
8)Bonus – Decision Boundary Match: Decision boundary plots mapped to classifirs.

# Task 2: The Rise of the WeatherMind  
1)Goal: Develop an LLM-powered agentic AI assistant using LangGraph and tool-enhanced reasoning.
2)Levels Covered
3)Core Activation: LangGraph + Gemini + Calculator Tool
4)Senses of World: Addition of Fashion and Weather Tools using API calls
5)Judgement and Memory: Implementing tool-routing logic and conversational memory
6)Multi-Agent Evolution: Building a multi-agent interaction with task-specific roles
